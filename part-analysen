-- Wie viele *clickouts* werden pro session_id mit den unterschiedlichen devices erzeugt? Vergleiche die Gruppen A und B.

#####

Based on the Data Set there is only one Session (keea1bqaoaek8g1e7f3rpc8rh6) from group A where 2 different devices were used: Tablet for Clickout & Pageview and Desktop for 3 Pageviews (page_type=semp).

In this case we cannot compare two groups and answer the given question.

Instead we can calculate Average  # Clickouts per Session for group A and B (regardless the device used):

For Variant A AVG number of Clickouts per Session is 1.88
For Variant B AVG NUmber of Clickouts per Session is 1.66

Conclusion: The AVG number of Clickouts in Variant A is 13% bigger then in Variant B. In other words, people are more likely to go to the partner website having Variant A. 
Note: Only those sessions were considered for which there was at least one clickout


#### 
Query to find out Sessions were multiple Devices were used:

SELECT * FROM
     (
     SELECT s.session_id,
     COUNT(DISTINCT(device_type_id)) AS COUNT_DEVICE,
     SUM(clickout)
     FROM fact_main
     JOIN Sessions1 s ON s.session_id_1=fact_main.session_id_1
     GROUP BY 1
     ) as SUB
WHERE SUB.COUNT_DEVICE>1


### Query to find out the average number of clickouts in both variants A and B:

SELECT SUB.variant_id, AVG(SUB.clickouts)
FROM
(
  SELECT
  session_id_1,
  variant_id,
  SUM(clickout) as clickouts 
     FROM fact_main
     WHERE clickout>0
     GROUP BY 1,2
) as SUB

GROUP BY 1


-- Wie hoch ist der Anteil der Sessions mit nur einem einzigen Seitenaufruf, ohne clickout an der Gesamtzahl der Sessions?
###### 

82,8% is the share of sessions with only one pageview

########
QUERY:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(SUB.session_id_1)) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(session_id_1)) FROM fact_main)  -- WE DIVIDE #SESSIONS WITH ONLY ONE PAGEVIEW THROUGH TOTAL NUMBER OF ALL SESSIONS o

FROM

(
SELECT session_id_1,
       COUNT(id) as c
       FROM fact_main
       WHERE clickout=0
       GROUP BY 1) SUB   -- SUB QUERY RETURNS SESSIONS WHERE THERE WERE NO CLICKOUTS DURING the Session (clickout=0)
WHERE  c=1               -- IN THE WHERE CONDITION WE SPECIFY THAT WE NEED ONLY SESSIONS WHERE THE NUMBER OF PAGEVIEWS=1 



-- Wie lange dauert eine Session?
##################

For Variant A Average Session Duration is 5 min 57 sec (357 sec)
For Variant B Average Session Duration is 4 min 46 sec (286 sec)  

For both Variants AVG Session Duration is 5 min 21 sec (321 sec)

Conclusion: Users spend on Average 1 min 11 sec more on the website with Variant A

Note: In the calculation we do not consider sessions with only one page view, since there is only one timestample (start) while we need both timestamps start + end
